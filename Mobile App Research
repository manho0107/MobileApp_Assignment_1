Assignment: Mobile App Research

Mobile technology started playing an important role in our daily lives since the first iPhone was introduced by Steven Job on January 9, 2007 [1]. It transformed a phone-call-and-message-based mobile device to a multifunctional smartphone. Since this first successful launch of the first iPhone in the world, other companies such as Samsung, HTC, and Google etc. manufactured their own smartphones. After 16 years of development, apart from smartphone, smart watch, tablet, and even V.R. glasses were developed by a variety of corporations and all these devices migrated into our daily lives. It brings ease of life to everyone and entirely changed our way of life. The popularity of mobile technology applications can be proved by figures. According to [2], [3] and [4], forecasts show that there will be a total 6.92 billion of smartphones, 11 million of tablets, and 224.27 million of smartwatch sold worldwide by the conclusion of 2023.
Beside of transformation of a communication-based phone to multifunction-based smartphone, mobile technology was developed with numerous personalized functions on smartphone, tablet, and smartwatch, including but not limited to, for instance, mobile banking, stock trading, video streaming, fitness tracking, contactless payment, social networking, breaking news notification, and smart home control etc. Because of fast-paced data and information exchange associated with mobile technology, all smart devices require better battery life, faster processer, and high speed of connectivity etc. Manufacturers needs to implement more research and improve its products to suit the latest technology. Meanwhile, more different mobile apps are expected to launch numerously. As smart devices require wireless connection for operation, telecommunication company already introduced 5G connection which provide a transmission speed of 20Gbps from early 2019 [5] and 6G with a speed of 100 times of 5G is expected to launch commercially in 2030 [6].  In addition to this, due to the switch of using hard drive storage to cloud service, with the benefits brought by higher transmission speed, we can foresee the popularity of online storage demand will rise continuously. As stated by [7], AR and VR application, blockchain development, cloud service, and Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) etc. are forecasted to be evolving rapidly in the coming 10 years. It can be foreseen by history. For instance, Apple and Amazon launched their own developed A.I., Siri and Alexa, in 2011 and 2014 respectively. Neither of them was able to provide accurate responses. However, ChatGPT introduced in 2022 can answer all questions in all aspects. There will be opportunities for other technologies to develop such as increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies pushes a rapid development of blockchain technology with a compound annual growth rate of 56.3% as of 2023 [8].
Because of the rapid mobile technology development, the demand for mobile app developers, A.I. and Machine Learning personnel, AR and VR Developers, Cloud Service Developer and Administrator, and Data Analysts and Scientists are expected to tremendously increase. Mobile technology collects users’ data and implements automatic analysis which lowers the demand of manual analysis personnel. Legacy mobile OS developers may not be required anymore as they are not able to develop operating systems with new technologies. Technicians such as SIM card technicians will fade out because of increasing use of e-SIM.
